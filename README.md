# Dungeons and Dragons Translations

This repository contains a database of common vocabulary translated into various languages to aid players and game masters avoid injecting English words into their games. With time, this allows for better flow of the game and gives confidence to participants who are not comfortable using English.

> *Note:* This is a community-driven project unrelated to Wizard of the Coast, the creators of Dungeons and Dragons.
